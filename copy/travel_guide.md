North Bay Python is taking place at the Mystic Theatre in historic Downtown Petaluma. The Mystic was constructed in 1912 as a Vaudeville theatre, and has undergone many changes over the years. These days, it's Petaluma's premier live music venue.

Petaluma's a shockingly quaint dairy town at the south end of Sonoma County, full of well preserved Victorian architecture and BLAH. We're in the middle of one of the powerhouses of agriculture and viticulture in California, so Petaluma is full of restaurants that specialize in very local food and wine. Petaluma is also home to the world-famous Lagunitas Brewing Company, as well as numerous artisan distilleries and wine makers.
