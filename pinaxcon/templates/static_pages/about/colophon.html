<h2>Call for Proposals</h2>

<p>Portions of our <a href="/program/call-for-proposals">Call for Proposals</a> page were drawn from ideas seen on <a href="https://djangocon.eu" title="DjangoCon Europe">DjangoCon EU</a>, <a href="https://seagl.org" title="Seattle GNU Linux">SeaGL</a>, <a href="http://www.fogcityruby.com/speak/" title="Fog City Ruby">Fog City Ruby</a>, and others. Thanks to all for their inspiration and permission to borrow!</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Our <a href="/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> was forked from the <a href="https://github.com/python/pycon-code-of-conduct">PyCon US Code of Conduct</a>, including the staff and attendee guides, under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a> license, itself originally forked from the example policy from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy">Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the <a href="https://adainitiative.org/">Ada Initiative</a> and other volunteers, which is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero</a> license.</p>

<h2>Fiscal Sponsor</h2>

<p>Our fiscal sponsor is <a href="https://sfconservancy.org">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to the promotion and development of free and open source software. Conservancy allows us to work without managing our own corporate structure and administrative services. Our relationship with Conservancy goes beyond logistics, though, as we are also philosophically aligned as we work to advance software freedom and expand the Python developer community.</p>
