<p>The Mystic and Hotel Petaluma are both located in downtown Petaluma which is compact and walkable, but some hotels are further afield and you may find a need for taxis or public transit. Here you'll find a guide to local transit. You can find information about parking on the <a href="/attend/travel">Travel</a> page.</p>
