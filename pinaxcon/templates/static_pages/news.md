## Third annual North Bay Python to take place in Petaluma, California on November 2-3, 2019

**Tuesday, April 23, 2019**&mdash;The North Bay Python team is excited to announce we’re on for our third annual conference! North Bay Python 2019 will be hosted the first weekend of November 2nd and 3rd at the Mystic Theater in downtown Petaluma, an hour north of the Golden Gate.

Hundreds of Pythonistas and the Python-curious will gather for the conference in a historic music venue, at the intersection of Sonoma, Marin, and Napa County. Some will travel solo, others may bring their families along to enjoy local hikes, museums, wine tours, windswept beaches, and lots of kid-friendly activities.

Details about travel, lodging, accommodation, and much more can be found on our website. In July, we will begin seeking proposals from people interested in speaking at the conference. In August, we’ll begin selling tickets.
